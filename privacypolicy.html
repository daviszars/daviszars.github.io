    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: March 23, 2025</em></p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Hedgy app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Davis Zarins (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application is designed to function primarily offline and minimizes data collection. The Service Provider does not personally collect or store any user data beyond what is automatically collected by Apple through App Store Connect (such as basic installation metrics, crash reports, and performance data).</p>

    <h2>Screen Time API</h2>
    <p>The Application uses Apple's Screen Time API to access data about your device usage patterns. This data is processed entirely on your device and is not transmitted to or stored by the Service Provider.</p>

    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>The Application uses CoreLocation for geofencing features to detect when you enter or exit specified geographic areas. All location processing occurs locally on your device. The Service Provider does not collect, store, or transmit your location data.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
    <p>The Application uses RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect transaction information and device identifiers necessary for processing purchases. Please refer to <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how they handle your data.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider may disclose information only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process</li>
        <li>When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
    <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the App Store.</p>

    <p>You can also disable specific permissions such as Screen Time access or Location Services through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>As the Service Provider does not collect or store user data beyond what Apple automatically provides through App Store Connect, there is no user data to retain or delete on the Service Provider's end.</p>

    <p>For information about RevenueCat's data retention policies, please refer to their privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>

    <p>The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. In the case the Service Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately take steps to delete any such information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider at bard.step0l@icloud.com.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding your privacy. As the Application operates primarily offline with data processing occurring on your device, the risk of unauthorized access to your data is minimized.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of March 23, 2025.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at bard.step0l@icloud.com.</p>
